题目最优解是时间和空间复杂度都为O(n)，使用哈希表不是最优解，
应该使用 XOR

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            res ^= n;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

For anyone who didn't understood why this works here is an explanation. This XOR operation works because it's like XORing all the numbers by itself. So if the array is {2,1,4,5,2,4,1} then it will be like we are performing this operation

```
((2^2)^(1^1)^(4^4)^(5)) => (0^0^0^5) => 5.
```

Hence picking the odd one out ( 5 in this case).
