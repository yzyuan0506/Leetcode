        G[0] = 1; // empty tree has only 1 combination
        G[1] = 1; // tree with one node has only one combination
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                G[i] += G[j-1] * G[i-j];

    }
};

G[n] refers to the maximum number of unique combinations that a n-node BST can have

G[0] and G[1] are base case:
G[0] means an empty tree only has one combination.

G[2] = G[0] * G[1] + G[1] * G[0]
G[3] = G[0] * G[2] + G[1] * G[1] + G[2] * G[0]
