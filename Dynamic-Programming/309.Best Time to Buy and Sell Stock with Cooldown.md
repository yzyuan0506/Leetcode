On any i-th day, we can buy, sell or cooldown

buy[i]: The maximum profit can be made if the first i days end with buy or wait. E.g "buy, sell, buy" or "buy, cooldown, cooldown"
sell[i]: The maximum profit can be made if the first i days end with sell or wait. E.g "buy, sell, buy, sell" or "buy, sell, cooldown, cooldown"
price: prices[i - 1], which is the stock price of the i-th day

To calculate sell[i]:
If we sell on the i-th day, the maximum profit is buy[i - 1] + price, because we have to buy before we can sell.
If we cooldown on the i-th day, the maximum profit is same as sell[i - 1] since we did not do anything on the i-th day.
So sell[i] is the larger one of (buy[i - 1] + price, sell[i - 1])

To calculate buy[i]:
If we buy on the i-th day, the maximum profit is sell[i - 2] - price, because on the (i-1)th day we can only cooldown.
If we cooldown on the i-th day, the maximum profit is same as buy[i - 1] since we did not do anything on the i-th day.
So sell[i] is the larger one of (sell[i - 2] - price, buy[i - 1])

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int length = prices.length;
        // buy[i]: max profit if the first "i" days end with a "buy" day
        int[] buy = new int[length + 1];
        // buy[i]: max profit if the first "i" days end with a "sell" day
        int[] sell = new int[length + 1];
        
        buy[1] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= length; i++) {
            int price = prices[i - 1];
            buy[i] = Math.max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 2] - price);
            sell[i] = Math.max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + price);
        }
        
        // sell[length] >= buy[length]
        return sell[length];
    }
}
```

Since states of day i relies only on i-1 and i-2 we can reduce the O(n) space to O(1). And here we are at our final solution:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = INT_MIN, prev_buy = 0, sell = 0, prev_sell = 0;
        for(int price : prices) {
            prev_buy = buy;
            buy = max(prev_sell - price, prev_buy);
            prev_sell = sell;
            sell = max(prev_buy + price, prev_sell);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};
```
