We iterate through the input array exactly once, keeping track of the running sum mod k of the elements in the process. If we find that a running sum value at index j has been previously seen before in some earlier index i in the array, then we know that the sub-array (i,j] contains a desired sum.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if(nums.size() < 1) return 0;
        // key: pre remainder, value: minimum index of the array that get the remainder
        unordered_map<int,int> preRemainders;   
        preRemainders[0] = -1;  // deal with k = 0
        
        int runningSum = 0; 
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            runningSum += nums[i];
            if(k != 0) runningSum %= k;
            // if there is a same remainder exists previously
            if(preRemainders.find(runningSum) != preRemainders.end()) {
                int prev = preRemainders[runningSum];
                if(i - prev > 1) return true;
            }
            // if same remainder has existed, no need to update, just keep the minimum index
            else preRemainders[runningSum] = i; 
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

(a+(n*x))%x is same as (a%x)

For e.g. in case of the array [23,2,6,4,7] k = 6
 the running sum is [23,25,31,35,42] and the remainders are [5,1,1,5,0]. We got remainder 5 at index 0 and at index 3. That means, in between these two indexes we must have added a number which is multiple of the k. Hope this clarifies your doubt :)


A proof sketch:
Suppose sum_i represents the running sum starting from index 0 and ending at i,
once we find a mod that has been seen, say modk, we have:
current one: sum_i = m*k + modk
previous one: sum_j = n*k + modk
Thus,
sum_i - sum_j = (m - n) *k
