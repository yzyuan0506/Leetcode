class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int index = abs(nums[i]) - 1; // index start from 0
            nums[index] = nums[index] > 0? -nums[index] : nums[index]; 
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if(nums[i] > 0) res.push_back(i+1);

First iteration to negate values at position whose equal to values appear in array. Second iteration to collect all position whose value is positive, which are the missing values. Complexity is O(n) Time and O(1) space.

The basic idea is that we iterate through the input array and mark elements as negative using nums[nums[i] -1] = -nums[nums[i]-1]. In this way all the numbers that we have seen will be marked as negative. In the second iteration, if a value is not marked as negative, it implies we have never seen that index before, so just add it to the return list.
